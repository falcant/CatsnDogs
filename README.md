# Cats and Dogs Classification Challenge
The following project was part of a final presentation for my class "Matrix Method in Data Analysis and Pattern Recognition" (Math 521)
at California State University, Long Beach. The Project consist in using 160 images of cats and dogs (80 each) in order to 
build a pattern recognition architecture learned in class. 
## Method Used
One of the possible approaches is to classiffy the images is using Convolutional Neural Network. Since I was assisting one of my 
research advisors in the construction of Neural Networks (see project in remote sensing), I opted for this option.
